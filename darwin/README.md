# macOS - darwin

## Missing parts in Nix and home-manager

Several packages are missing or broken for darwin. Or the x86-64 darwin.\
So you should manually install followings.

- [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- [zed-editor](https://zed.dev/download)
- [podman-desktop](https://podman-desktop.io/downloads)
- [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/ja/firefox/all/desktop-release/osx/ja/)
- [cloudflare-warp](https://developers.cloudflare.com/warp-client/get-started/macos/)

## Limitations

- I only have x86-64 macbook pro, it is much slow in GitHub action macos-13 runner.\
  So preferring macos-15 Apple Silicon runner in several place...
