# macOS - darwin

## Missing parts in Nix and home-manager

Several packages are missing or broken for darwin. Or the x86-64 darwin.\
So you should manually install followings.

- [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- [zed-editor](https://zed.dev/download)
- [podman-desktop](https://podman-desktop.io/downloads)

## Limitations

- I only have x86-64 macbook pro, it is much slow in GitHub action macos-13 runner.\
  So preferring macos-14 runner in several place...
