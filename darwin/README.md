# macOS - Darwin

I basically [give up to maintain macOS environment](https://github.com/kachick/dotfiles/issues/911).

1. Apply home-manager with `kachick@macbook` for minimum packages.
1. Install [some packages](https://github.com/kachick/dotfiles/wiki/macOS) without Nix
1. Use Lima for development tasks.

Also read [wiki](https://github.com/kachick/dotfiles/wiki/macOS)
