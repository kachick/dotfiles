## How to run PowerShell scripts in this repo?

If you faced following error, needed to enable the permission from Administrator's PowerShell terminal

```plaintext
.\windows\scripts\enable_verbose_context_menu.ps1: File \\wsl.localhost\Ubuntu\home\kachick\repos\dotfiles\windows\scripts\enable_verbose_context_menu.ps1 cannot be loaded. The file \\wsl.localhost\Ubuntu\home\kachick\repos\dotfiles\windows\scripts\enable_verbose_context_menu.ps1 is not digitally signed. You cannot run this script on the current system. For more information about running scripts and setting execution policy, see about_Execution_Policies at https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=135170.

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope CurrentUser
```

```console
> Get-ExecutionPolicy -List

        Scope ExecutionPolicy
        ----- ---------------
MachinePolicy       Undefined
   UserPolicy       Undefined
      Process       Undefined
  CurrentUser    Unrestricted
 LocalMachine       Undefined
```

After completed tasks, disable it as follows

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```
