# Winget Package Lists

The JSON files in this directory are exported lists of `winget` packages.

They serve as a personal memorandum of useful or notable packages. They are not intended to be a definitive list of packages that are always installed.

For any given machine setup, the recommended approach is to create a custom JSON file containing only the desired packages and then use `winget import` to install them.
