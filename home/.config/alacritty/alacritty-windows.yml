# Import additional configuration files
#
# Imports are loaded in order, skipping all missing files, with the importing
# file being loaded last. If a field is already present in a previous import, it
# will be replaced.
#
# All imports must either be absolute paths starting with `/`, or paths relative
# to the user's home directory starting with `~/`.
import:
  - ~/.config/alacritty/alacritty-common.yml

# Shell
#
# You can set `shell.program` to the path of your favorite shell, e.g.
# `/bin/fish`. Entries in `shell.args` are passed unmodified as arguments to the
# shell.
#
# Default:
#   - (Linux/BSD/macOS) `$SHELL` or the user's login shell, if `$SHELL` is unset
#   - (Windows) powershell
shell:
  program: pwsh
  args:
