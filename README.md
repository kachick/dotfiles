## Installation - Linux(Ubuntu), Darwin

1. Install [Nix](https://nixos.org/) package manager with [DeterminateSystems/nix-installer](https://github.com/DeterminateSystems/nix-installer).
   ```bash
   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf -L https://install.determinate.systems/nix | sh -s -- install
   ```
1. Make sure there is a nix directory that is used in the home-manager.\
   This is a workaround, See [the thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nix/comments/1443k3o/comment/jr9ht5g/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) for detail
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/.local/state/nix/profiles
   ```
1. Restart current shell to load Nix as a PATH
   ```bash
   bash
   ```
1. Install [home-manager](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager) and dotfiles
   ```bash
   nix run 'github:kachick/dotfiles#home-manager' -- switch -b backup --flake 'github:kachick/dotfiles#kachick'
   ```

## Installation - Windows

Read [the tips](config/windows/README.md) and CI

## Note

If you are developing this repository, the simple reactivation is as follows.

```bash
makers apply
```

If you are using the [podman](https://podman.io/), You can test the pre-built [container-image](containers) as follows.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kachick/dotfiles/main/containers/sandbox-with-ghcr.bash | bash -euxo

## for developer
makers sandbox-cr
```

Using podmain may require to install some dependencies without Nix

```bash
# "shadow" in nixpkg is not enough for podman - https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/138423
sudo apt-get install uidmap
```

If you encounter any errors in the above steps, Check and update CI and [wiki](https://github.com/kachick/dotfiles/wiki).
