   This is a workaround, See [the thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nix/comments/1443k3o/comment/jr9ht5g/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) for detail
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/.local/state/nix/profiles
   ```

   ```
1. Make shells installed by nix into a login shell
   ```bash
   nix run 'github:kachick/dotfiles#sudo_enable_nix_login_shells'
   ```
1. If you have any problems with the installation steps, check both the [CI](.github/workflows/ci-home.yml) and the [wiki](https://github.com/kachick/dotfiles/wiki) and update them.
