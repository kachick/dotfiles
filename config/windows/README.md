# FAQ

## Installation

Basically following codes will be done in PowerShell

1. Download the windows helper binaries from [GitHub releases](https://github.com/kachick/dotfiles/releases) or uploaded artifacts in [each workflow](https://github.com/kachick/dotfiles/actions/workflows/release.yml) summary
1. New session of pwsh
   ```powershell
   ./winit-conf.exe -pwsh_profile_path "$PROFILE"
   ./winit-reg.exe list
   ./winit-reg.exe run --all
   ```
1. Install some tools
   ```powershell
   # Basically this may be same output of above `winit-conf.exe` log
   # Pick-up the winget-*.json outputs
   $env:TMP
   # => C:\Users\YOU\AppData\Local\Temp

   winget import --import-file "C:\Users\YOU\AppData\Local\Temp\winitRANDOM1\winget-pkgs-basic.json"
   # Optional
   winget import --import-file "C:\Users\YOU\AppData\Local\Temp\winitRANDOM2\winget-pkgs-storage.json"
   winget import --import-file "C:\Users\YOU\AppData\Local\Temp\winitRANDOM3\winget-pkgs-entertainment.json"
   ```
1. Remove needless pre-installed tools
   ```powershell
   # 9MSSGKG348SP is the Windows Widget(Windows Web Experience Pack)
   winget uninstall --id 9MSSGKG348SP
   ```
1. Change Dropbox storage path from `C:\Users`, default path made problems in System Restore.\
   See https://zmzlz.blogspot.com/2014/10/windows-dropbox.html for detail
1. Enable Bitlocker and backup the restore key

## How to print windows ENV?

AFAIK, %ENVNAME% can be replaced in PowerShell as follows

```console
~ psh
> $env:APPDATA
C:\Users\YOU\AppData\Roaming

~ psh
> $env:TMP
C:\Users\YOU\AppData\Local\Temp
```

[And golang source code is much helpful](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/f0d1195e13e06acdf8999188decc63306f9903f5/src/os/file.go#L500-L509)

## How to install WSL2?

winget does not support it, run as follows

```powershell
wsl.exe --install --distribution "Ubuntu-22.04"
```

## PowerShell startup is too slow

```plaintext
Loading personal and system profiles took 897ms.
```

TODO: Integrate https://github.com/kachick/PSFzfHistory here

Look at #430

1. Make sure `pwsh -NoProfile` is fast
1. Restart the pwsh, if it is fast, cache maybe generated. The slow may happen when updated windows and/or the runtimes. (I guess)
1. Do NOT consider about `ngen.exe` solution as Googling say. It looks old for me.

Reason: ngen.exe cannot compile latest pwsh

- How: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/add-an-exclusion-to-windows-security-811816c0-4dfd-af4a-47e4-c301afe13b26

One more noting, if you cannot find ngen.exe, dig under "C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework" as "C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319\ngen.exe"

## How to export winget list?

```powershell
winget export --output "\\wsl.localhost\Ubuntu-22.04\home\kachick\repos\dotfiles\config\windows\winget-pkgs-$(Get-Date -UFormat '%F')-raw.json"
```

It may be better to remove some packages such as `Mozilla.Firefox.DeveloperEdition`.

## History substring search in major shells for Windows

TODO: Integrate https://github.com/kachick/PSFzfHistory here

- PowerShell: #291, Written in [Profile.ps1](powershell/Profile.ps1) and commented out because it makes starting up much slow!
- nushell: But [it also does not have substring search like a zsh](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/discussions/7968)

## Why avoiding winget to install Firefox Developer Edition?

No Japanese locale is registered in winget yet, official installer is supporting.

## How to run PowerShell scripts in this repo?

If you faced following error, needed to enable the permission from Administrator's PowerShell terminal

```plaintext
.\windows\scripts\enable_verbose_context_menu.ps1: File \\wsl.localhost\Ubuntu-22.04\home\kachick\repos\dotfiles\windows\scripts\enable_verbose_context_menu.ps1 cannot be loaded. The file \\wsl.localhost\Ubuntu-22.04\home\kachick\repos\dotfiles\windows\scripts\enable_verbose_context_menu.ps1 is not digitally signed. You cannot run this script on the current system. For more information about running scripts and setting execution policy, see about_Execution_Policies at https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=135170.
```

Executing loccal scrips just requires "RemoteSigned", but in wsl path, it is remote, so needed to relax more.

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope CurrentUser
```

```console
> Get-ExecutionPolicy -List

        Scope ExecutionPolicy
        ----- ---------------
MachinePolicy       Undefined
   UserPolicy       Undefined
      Process       Undefined
  CurrentUser    Unrestricted
 LocalMachine       Undefined
```

After completed tasks, disable it as follows

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

## History in PowerShell does not work...

If PowerShell in WindowsTerminal displaying as below,

```plaintext
PowerShell 7.3.6
Cannot load PSReadline module.  Console is running without PSReadline.
```

I have faced this problem when called `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Undefined -Scope CurrentUser`.\
Try to set the permission as `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser`

## Why are you still using Google Japanese Input? Why don't you prefer Microsoft IME?

Pros for Microsoft IME

- Preinstalled by Windows
- It is having cloud translations now (Called as "‰∫àÊ∏¨Â§âÊèõ")

Cons for Microsoft IME

- Needed to tab, not in space to get date as "„Åç„Çá„ÅÜ"
- No way to get date with ISO 8601 format

## How to completely disable Microsoft IME after installed Google Japanese Input?

[#300](https://github.com/kachick/dotfiles/issues/300) is the steps.

## Containers?

I now prefer podman over docker and singularity.\
It needs special WSL distribution. How to run it from standard WSL ubuntu is written in [this document](https://podman-desktop.io/docs/podman/accessing-podman-from-another-wsl-instance).\
Make sure you are using podman binary as podman-remote, nixpkgs product does not satisfy.\
This repository aliases podman command to mise installed binary.
